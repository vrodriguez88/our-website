<h2>How do I decide?</h2>
		<p> 
The best way to decide which test is right for you is to take a timed full-length practice test in each. Since the content and style of the SAT and ACT are very similar, factors like how you handle time pressure and what types of questions you find most challenging can help you determine which test is a better fit. For example, the pace of the SAT gives you a tad more time to think through problems, while the ACT can be more of a time crunch. Some students really thrive under the pressure of the clock, while others prefer the extra time to ponder a question.
		</p>

<h2>Whats the difference?</h2>
		<p> 
Colleges accept both tests equally, so the choice is up to you! The ACT and SAT generally test the same types of content. The biggest differences are that the ACT has a Science Test and the SAT has one Math section for which you cannot use a calculator.
		</p>

<h2>Do practice tests help?</h2>
		<p> 
Yes! Practing the exams is the best way to gage how you will preform in the real testing environment. Check out our practice test links down below! practice makes perfect! 
		</p>

<h2>What are the different sections of the SAT?</h2>
		<p> 
The sections of the SAT are math, evidence-based reading and writing. An
optional essay is also offered.
